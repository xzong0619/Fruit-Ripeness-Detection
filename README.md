# Fruit Ripeness Detection React Application
(placeholder: showing final web app detection result)

This app can be used for real time object detection be leveraging [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Tensorflow JS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js). This repository contains the code and Google Colab notebook (add link) for training a detector of banana ripeness.

### Problem Statement
The model is used to detect the ripeness stages of bananas. 

The corresponding labels are:

- Freshripe
- Freshunripe
- Overripe
- Ripe
- Rotten
- Unripe

### Training image examples
The images used for training are taken from [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/fruit-ripening/fruit-ripening-process/dataset/2). There are 5.3K images for training and 757 images for test.

- Freshripe

- Freshunripe

- Overripe

- Ripe

- Rotten

- Unripe
